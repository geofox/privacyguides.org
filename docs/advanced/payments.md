Making payments online while retaining your privacy is a difficult challenge. The traditional banking infrastructure is intentionally designed in an anti-privacy manner to enable banks, other companies, and governments to easily trace transactions for a variety of purposes. Many people online view cryptocurrencies as the solution to this problem, but there are still a significant number of privacy concerns with existing cryptocurrencies.

## Cash

For centuries, **cash** has functioned as the primary form of private payment. Cash has excellent privacy properties in most cases, is widely accepted in most countries, and is **fungible**, meaning it is non-unique and completely interchangable.

Cash payment laws vary by country. In the United States, special disclosure is required for cash payments over $10,000 to the IRS on [Form 8300](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/form-8300-and-reporting-cash-payments-of-over-10000). The receiving business is required to ID verify the payee’s name, address, occupation, date of birth, and Social Security Number or other TIN (with some exceptions). Lower limits without ID such as $3,000 or less exist for exchanges and money transmission. Cash also contains serial numbers. These are almost never tracked by merchants, but they can be used by law enforcement in targeted investigations.

Despite this, when you can use cash it’s typically the best option.

## Prepaid Cards & Gift Cards

It’s relatively simple to purchase gift cards and prepaid cards at most grocery stores and convenience stores with cash. Gift cards usually don’t have a fee, though prepaid cards often do, so pay close attention to these fees and expiry dates. Some stores may ask to see your ID at checkout to reduce fraud.

Gift cards usually have limits of up to $200 per card, but some offer limits of up to $2,000 per card. Prepaid cards (eg: from Visa or Mastercard) usually have limits of up to $1,000 per card.

Gift cards have the downside of being subject to merchant policies, which can have terrible terms and restrictions. For example, some merchants don’t accept payment in gift cards exclusively, or they may cancel the value of the card if they consider you to be a high-risk user. Once you have merchant credit, the merchant has a strong degree of control over this credit.

Prepaid cards don’t allow cash withdrawals from ATMs or “peer-to-peer” payments in Venmo and similar apps.

Cash remains the best option for in-person purchases for most people. Gift cards can be useful for the savings they bring. Prepaid cards can be useful for places that don’t accept cash. Gift cards and prepaid cards are easier to use online than cash, and they are easier to acquire with cryptocurrencies than cash.

### Online Marketplaces

If you have cryptocurrency, you can purchase gift cards with an online gift card marketplace. Some of these services offer ID verification options for higher limits, but they also allow accounts with just an email address. Basic limits start at $5,000-10,000 a day for basic accounts, and significantly higher limits for ID verified accounts (if offered).

When buying gift cards online, there is usually a slight discount. Prepaid cards are usually sold online at face value or with a fee. If you buy prepaid cards and gift cards with cryptocurrencies, you should strongly prefer to pay with Monero which provides strong privacy, more on this below. Paying for a gift card with a traceable payment method negates the benefits a gift card can provide when purchased with cash or Monero. Some online gift card marketplaces which accept Monero include [Cake Pay](https://cakepay.com/) and [CoinCards](https://coincards.com/).

## Payment Masking Services

There are also a number of services which provide "virtual debit cards" which you can use with online merchants without revealing your actual banking or billing information in most cases. It's important to note that these financial services are **not** anonymous and are subject to "Know Your Customer" (KYC) laws and may require your ID or other identifying information. These services are primarily useful for protecting you from merchant data breaches, less sophisticated tracking or purchase correlation by marketing agencies, and online data theft; and **not** for making a purchase completely anonymously.

Many banks and credit card providers offer native virtual card functionality. If you use one which provides this option already, you should use it over the following recommendations in most cases. That way you are not trusting multiple parties with your personal information.

### Privacy.com (US, Free)

!!! recommendation

    **Privacy.com**'s free plan allows you to create up to 12 virtual cards per month, set spend limits on those cards, and shut off cards instantly.

- Allows the creation of multiple cards which function as a shield between the merchant and your personal finances.
- Cards must not require you to provide accurate billing address information to the merchant.

## Cryptocurrency

!!! danger

    The vast majority of cryptocurrencies operate on a **public** blockchain, meaning that every transaction is public knowledge. This includes even most well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transactions with these cryptocurrencies should not be considered private and will not protect your anonymity.

    Additionally, many if not most cryptocurrencies are scams. Make transactions carefully with only projects you trust.

### Monero

![Monero logo](../assets/img/payments/monero.svg){ align=right }

**Monero** uses a blockchain with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity. Every Monero transaction hides the transaction amount, sending and receiving addresses, and source of funds without any hoops to jump through, making it an ideal choice for cryptocurrency novices. Outside observers cannot decipher addresses trading Monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories.

[:octicons-heart-16:](https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/contributing/){ .card-link title=Contribute }

For optimal privacy, make sure to use a noncustodial wallet where the view key stays on the device. This means that only you will have the ability to spend your funds and see incoming and outgoing transactions. If you use a custodial wallet, the provider can see **everything** you do; if you use a “lightweight” wallet where the provider retains your private view key, the provider can see almost everything you do.

For maximum privacy (even with a noncustodial wallet), you should run your own Monero node. Using another person’s node will expose some information to them, such as the IP address that you connect to it from, the timestamps that you sync your wallet, and the transactions that you send from your wallet (though no other details about those transactions). Alternatively, you can connect to someone else’s Monero node over Tor or i2p.

#### Privacy Concerns

In August 2021, CipherTrace [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciphertrace-announces-enhanced-monero-tracing-160000275.html) enhanced Monero tracing capabilities for government agencies. Public postings show that the US Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [licensed](https://sam.gov/opp/d12cbe9afbb94ca68006d0f006d355ac/view) CipherTrace's "Monero Module" in late 2022.

Monero transaction graph privacy is limited by its relatively small ring signatures, especially against targeted attacks. Monero's privacy features have also been [called into question](https://web.archive.org/web/20180331203053/https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/) by some security researchers, and a number of severe vulnerabilities have been found and patched in the past, so the claims made by organizations like CipherTrace are not out of the question. While it's unlikely that Monero mass surveillance tools exist like they do for Bitcoin and others, it's certain that tracing tools assist with targeted investigations.

Ultimately, Monero is the strongest contender for a privacy-friendly cryptocurrency, but its privacy claims have **not** been definitively proven one way or the other. More time and research is needed to assess whether Monero is resilient enough to attacks to always provide adequate privacy.

#### Acquisition

Acquiring Monero privately can be difficult. [LocalMonero](https://localmonero.co/), a platform which facilitates trades between people, is one option that can be used. If using an exchange which requires KYC is an acceptable risk for you as long as subsequent transactions can't be traced, a much easier option is to purchase Monero on an exchange like [Kraken](https://kraken.com/), or purchase Bitcoin/Litecoin from a KYC exchange which can then be swapped for Monero. Then, you can withdraw the purchased Monero to your own noncustodial wallet to use privately from that point forward.

If you go this route, make sure to purchase Monero at different times and in different amounts than where you will spend it. If you purchase $5000 of Monero at an exchange and make a $5000 purchase in Monero an hour later, those actions could potentially be correlated by an outside observer regardless of which path the Monero took. Staggering purchases and purchasing larger amounts of Monero in advance to later spend on multiple smaller transactions can avoid this pitfall.

- Cryptocurrency must provide private/untraceable transactions by default.

## Additional Considerations

When you're making a payment in-person with cash, make sure to keep your in-person privacy in mind. Security cameras are ubiquitous. Consider wearing non-distinct clothing and a face mask (such as a surgical mask or N95). Don’t sign up for rewards programs or provide any other information about yourself.

When purchasing online, ideally you should do so over [Tor](tor-overview.md). However, many merchants don’t allow purchases with Tor. You can consider using a [recommended VPN](../vpn.md) (paid for with cash, gift card, or Monero), or making the purchase from a coffee shop or library with free Wi-Fi. If you are ordering a physical item that needs to be delivered, you will need to provide a delivery address. You should consider using a PO box, private mailbox, or work address.
